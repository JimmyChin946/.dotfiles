# i3blocks config file
#
# Please see man i3blocks for a complete reference!
# The i3blocks man page is a great resource.

# General configuration, see i3blocks(1) for details.
# i3blocks defaults to an interval of 1 second per block, it can be changed to something else,
# which can reduce the system's battery usage.
interval=5
separator=true
separator_block_width=15

# Global defaults for the blocks.
# If you don't specify the script path, the script will be searched in $PATH.
#
# The script can be set to an absolute path, or a name.
#
# If the script has no interval, it will be executed only once at startup.
# The script can also be triggered by a signal using the '-s SIGxxxx' option.
# If the script prints multiple lines, only the first line will be displayed.
